    "I had a lot of issues when trying to view iGraph plots, which prompted me to search for other Python modules for viewing node and edge graphs.  I stumbled upon this GitHub repository (https://github.com/graphistry/pygraphistry) for a module called Graphistry.  The team that designed it is from University of California at Berkeley. It had lots of demonstrations for how to use the module's features effectively, and I thought it would be a great way to implement the graphical part of this analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Graphistry is a very cool tool, because it allows the user to work interactively with the plot without changing the code each time.  Here are some of the things I noticed about Clinton's email network:\n",
    "\n",
    "With the histogram tool in the control panel, I filtered the different number of users.  When it was set to be only points with degree 24.5k and up, the only point was Hillary Clinton.  I found that Hillary is just like me, and must occasionally send herself emails as reminders, since she was the only point on the filtered graph, but it still had four edges.  I can also see that she responded directly to less than half of the emails she recieved, as her degree_in is 18,040, and her degree_out is 7,361. \n",
    "\n",
    "I filtered the graph to only include those with degree 70 and higher.  I chose 70 based on the calculation below, which found that 70 is the average degree of Clinton's email contacts.  This left 30 nodes in the graph, implying that Clinton had a small, but very close circle of confidants among her colleagues. \n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest drawback of Graphistry is that it appears to have been designed to work primarily with comma separated value files and Python's Pandas module, and this data is in JSON format.  To work around this in my following steps, I converted the file to CSV using this website: http://konklone.io/json/"

The only node that is clearly sized larger than the others is Hillary Clinton, in the center of the graph.  So, the pagerank algorithm only found a big difference between her node and every other node.  This feature of the module could be used better in a different situation, where the nodes are not all directly connected to one person in particular.  Interestingly, there is another community in dark blue which also includes Hillary.  This could reflect a difference between colleague networks and family and friends networks.  Besides these communitites, there are a few smaller communities, probably reflecting separate projects that she is taking part in that do not directly pertain to her work as Secretary of State."
